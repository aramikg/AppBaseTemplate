logger for use with Sails, allowing easy custom configuration.\n\n\n#### Default log levels\n\nBased on [npm's log levels](https://github.com/isaacs/npmlog#loglevelprefix-message-)\n\n\n+ `log.silly()`\n+ `log.verbose()`\n+ `log.info()`\n+ `log.debug()`\n  + (npm calls this level `log.http()`, but we call it `debug`.  If you use `log()`, the logger sees this as a call to `log.debug()`)\n+ `log.warn()`\n+ `log.error()`\n\n\n\n\n#### Custom Examples\n\n```javascript\n\n\n/**\n * Using Winston\n * ====================================\n * \n * Formerly, this module encapsulated Winston, a popular logger\n * by @indexzero and the gals/guys over at Nodejitsu.\n * Recently, we made Winston optional to make CaptainsLog as\n * lightweight as possible and reduce `npm install`/`require()`\n * for its usage in other modules.\n *\n * But Winston is awesome!  And it's a great fit for many apps,\n * giving you granular control over how log output is handled,\n * including sending emails, logging to multiple transports,\n * and other production-time concerns.\n *\n * More info/docs on Winston:\n * https://github.com/flatiron/winston\n * \n * To use Winston w/ captains-log, do the following:\n\n\t\tvar captains = CaptainsLog({\n\t\t\tcustom: new (require('winston').Logger)({\n\t\t\t\tlevels     : ...,\n\t\t\t\ttransports : ...\n\t\t\t})\n\t\t});\n *\n */\n\n/**\n *\n * Using your own custom logger\n * ====================================\n * \n * To use a different library, `overrides.custom` must already\n * be instantiated and ready to go with (at minimum) an n-ary `.debug()`\n * method.  i.e. by n-ary, I mean that the following should\n * work (with any # of arguments):\n\t\n\t\tcustomLogger.debug()\n\t\tcustomLogger.debug('blah')\n\t\tcustomLogger.debug('blah', 'foo')\n\t\tcustomLogger.debug('blah', 'foo', {bar: 'baz'})\n\t\tcustomLogger.debug('blah', 'foo', {bar: 'baz'}, ['a', 3], 2, false);\n\t\t// etc.\n\n\t\t// To use a custom logged\n\t\tvar captains = CaptainsLog({\n\t\t\tcustom: customLogger\n\t\t});\n *\n */\n\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"balderdashy","email":"mike@balderdash.co"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-06-30T14:34:19.625Z","created":"2013-12-14T05:18:46.013Z","0.10.0":"2013-12-14T05:19:04.665Z","0.10.3":"2013-12-14T23:26:17.896Z","0.10.4":"2013-12-14T23:45:35.177Z","0.10.5":"2013-12-15T00:05:17.856Z","0.10.6":"2013-12-23T00:52:57.992Z","0.11.0":"2014-01-16T06:39:00.359Z","0.11.1":"2014-01-19T04:54:28.417Z","0.11.5":"2014-02-06T01:34:41.866Z","0.11.6":"2014-03-05T23:19:27.557Z","0.11.7":"2014-03-12T23:45:54.151Z","0.11.8":"2014-05-01T00:11:18.945Z","0.11.9":"2014-06-29T19:53:37.912Z","0.11.10":"2014-06-30T14:16:01.122Z","0.11.11":"2014-06-30T14:34:19.625Z"},"author":{"name":"Mike McNeil"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/mikermcneil/captains-log.git"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/mikermcneil/captains-log","keywords":["winston","sails","log","logger","waterline"],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mikermcneil/captains-log/issues"},"license":"MIT","users":{"magemagic":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"1ITEGRO6ZFJJC0SS4PFBIQGCG\""}
